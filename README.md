# School District Analysis - Peyton Arana

## School District Analysis Overview
The purpose of this request was to help the local school district gather information for how their students are performing in their Math and Reading subjects. We were able to give them information on how they performed based on grade level, spending levels per student, school type, and school size. We also were able to adjust the documentation to take into account the cheating scandal at Thomas High School, and we were are able to show how this changed affected the district as a whole. 

### School District Results
* The district has a whole which contains 39,170 students and they averaged 78.9 on their Math subject and 81.9 on the Reading subject. This translates to 74.8% of students passing in Math, 85.7% passing in Reading and 64.7% passing both sections.

* The district summary before taking into account the cheating scandal as seen below shows that the events in the 9th grade at Thomas High School had very little effect on the numbers as a whole, which may in part have to do with it being only 461 students that were affected as the district has accounts for a little over 1% of the entire district student volume.

* There is very little change that takes place when you take into consideration the removal of the grades on the [Math scores](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Math_Scores_By_Grades.PNG) by grade, [Reading scores](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Reading_Scores_By_Grades.PNG) by grade, [spending per student](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Spending_Per_Student.PNG), [school size](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_Size.PNG), or [school type](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_Type.PNG)

* While on a macro level, the numbers were not as affected Thomas High School was most affected by the cheating scandal as [before the numbers were changed](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_District_Summary_Pre_Fix.PNG had passing percentages in Math of 66.9%, Reading of 69.7%, overall 65%. This put them in the middle of the district scholastically. Thomas High School saw their scores increase dramatically once the 9th graders scores were removed. They [increased to a pass rate](https://github.com/pbarana89/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_District_Summary_Post_Fix.PNG) of 93.2% in Math, 97.1% in reading, and 90.6% overall. This saw them move to the top of the district in terms of percentages.

### School District Summary
The changes after the removal of the scores at Thomas High as stated were not felt on a district level. The district numbers saw almost no change in the numbers, but that should not downplay the effects this could have had on the district as a whole. When making decisions on funding, before the change Thomas High was passing Math as a whole at 67% and after the numbers were fixed, this changed to 93%. This could have led to a situation where resources are not put in properly. The same situation could have been viewed as their Reading score moved from 70% to 97% and overall passing increased from 65% to 91%. Even though these actions affected a little only 1% of the students and their grades, without catching this it could have led to bigger issues as a school like Thomas could have been viewed as one of the worst performing instead of one of the best, and this could have caused incorrect distribution of resources for the district.
